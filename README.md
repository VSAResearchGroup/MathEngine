# Virtual Student Advisor - Math Engine v0.1
***
## Project Description
We propose a linear-programming based mathematical recommendation engine to provide on-demand advising services to students of community colleges. To provide advising services, advisors are required to understand the prerequisites for the course. These prerequisites are required to be fulfilled by the students before enrolling into the course. The math engine suggests an academic plan after considering various other constraints such as availability of student throughout the week, budgetary constraints governed by the students financial conditions, availability of courses at different times of year, schedule of different courses, students employability conditions and pertaining restrictions, along with other real-life limitations and restraints.

## Demo
Check out a really simple [Demo here]()!

## Dependencies
This component is built as a Octave/MAtLab script, so a GNU Octave installation is required.

For download and installation, please refer to the instructions [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html).

## Installation
For version 0.1, you just need to download/clone this repository.

## Usage
  1. Download the repository and open the project in GNU Octave
  2. Run the 'procedure.m' script from 'bin' directory
  3. Check the generated plans in 'Output' directory

##Note
You can change the input by loading the 'DataStructure_WorkingSet.workspace' from the 'Input' directory and changing the 'ReqNet' variable in it.
